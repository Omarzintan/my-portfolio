      <h1>Zintan's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I am originally from Ghana and I am a rising Junior at Pomona College. I am a computer science major 
          and my interests are playing basketball, coding, listening to music and reading. I am very happy to be
          interning at Google this year. Even though it had to be remote, I still look forward to learning a lot.
