                <h2> My Background </h2>
                <p> Born and raised in Ghana, West Africa practically my whole life and I moved to the U.S. for 
                    college two years ago. I come from a small nuclear family of four. My older brother, Jemaa,
                    is four years older than me and lives in Connecticut. I am a rising Junior at Pomona College
                    and I believe going to college in California may be one of the best decisions I ever made (I 
                    love the weather!) I am excited to be working at Google for the first time. Even though this 
                    internship had to be remote, I still look forward to learning a lot.
                </p>
