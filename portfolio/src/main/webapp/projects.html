              <h1> My Projects </h1>
              <h2> GitLab Auto-Grading Bot </h2>
              <p1> During the summer of 2019, I developed a bot for assignemt grading as part of my summer internship with a professor from the Pomona College Computer
              Science department. This bot utilized GitLab infrastructure to provide a platform where students of the Artificial Intelligence course (CS151) could
              submit code and receive automatic feedback and grades from the bot. I worked with a team to develop, install and test this bot on Pomona's local GitLab
              repository. This bot aids the professor of this AI course with grading assignments.

              <h2> 4-node Raspberry Pi Cluster</h2>
              <p1> Also during the summer of 2019, I worked in the High Performace Computing (HPC) team in Pomona College's Information Technology Services (ITS) department. I built
              a 4-node Raspberry Pi Cluster in order to run and simulate certain software used in HPC such as slurm in an effort to test and explore the possibilities of 
              running HPC jobs from a Raspberry Pi Cluster. This cluster also serves as a way to explain concepts in HPC to others in a small digestible way since HPC is difficult
              to understand without hands-on experience. Building this cluster included assembling the nodes, working on network routing between the nodes for inter-node communication,
              setting up remote ssh access to the cluser, mounting a shared storage device, installing slurm and testing the cluster by running jobs on it.

              <h2> Web App for Cognitive Science Visual Illusions experiment</h2>
              <p1> During the spring semester of 2019 I designed and developed a light-weight web application for a visual illusions experiment for my Intro to Cognitive Science class. I developed
              this app using Python and Django. It featured a database of images of cards and an page for experimentation where subjects had to select between two options what they thought the
              full shape of a partly hidden card was. The database collected data as to whether subjects guessed rightly or wrongly. I used analysis of this data to present the results of my study.
